    /// <summary>Configures the zero-downtime failover between origins within a pool when session affinity is enabled. This feature is currently incompatible with Argo, Tiered Cache, and Bandwidth Alliance. The supported values are: - `&quot;none&quot;`: No failover takes place for sessions pinned to the origin (default). - `&quot;temporary&quot;`: Traffic will be sent to another other healthy origin until the originally pinned origin is available; note that this can potentially result in heavy origin flapping. - `&quot;sticky&quot;`: The session affinity cookie is updated and subsequent requests are sent to the new origin. Note: Zero-downtime failover with sticky sessions is currently not supported for session affinity by header.</summary>
